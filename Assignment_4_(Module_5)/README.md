# Python File I/O: Read, Write, Append

Three small Python scripts that demonstrate safe text file operations:
- **write_file** – creates/overwrite a file and adds initial text to the file
- **append_file** – adds additional text from the user to the end of a file 
- **read_file** – read and displays full and final file contents
